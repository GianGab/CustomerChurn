# CustomerChurn
   

One of my favourite data projects!   
   
**Context** - in this project, the scenario was that a broadband company had approached my team and I to perform some analytics on their data such as customer
demographics, service subscriptions and reasons for churning etc. On top of this we were to explore several models that would best predict the probability of a 
customer churning or not. 

**Contents** - the first workbook labelled EDA contains how we approached the EDA task (exploratory descriptive analysis). Here you can see most of this project's
visuals. The second workbook contains our modelling process in which we explored logistic regression, decision trees and random forest models.
